        <h3 class="h3"> 3 Scientific Benefits of Being a Cat Owner</h3>

        <p class="p1"> 1. OWNING A CAT IS BETTER FOR THE ENVIRONMENT.
            If you're worried about your carbon footprint, it’s better to own a cat than a dog. A 2009 study found that
            the resources needed to feed a dog over the course of its life create the same eco-footprint as that of a
            Land Cruiser. Meanwhile, cats—which eat less in general and are more likely to eat fish than corn- or
            beef-flavored products—only have the approximate carbon footprint of a small hatchback.  <br>
<br>
        2. YOU'LL HAVE A HEALTHIER HEART.
            Cats in particular lower your stress level—possibly since they don’t require as much effort as dogs—and
            lower the amount of anxiety in your life. Petting a cat has a positive calming effect. One study found that
            over a 10-year period cat owners were 30 percent less likely to die of a heart attack or stroke than non-cat
            owners (although this might just be because cat owners are more relaxed and have lower stress in general).  <br>
        <br>
         3.THEY CAN QUITE LITERALLY SAVE YOUR LIFE.
            Cats have a reputation of being aloof and not caring about their humans, but they have saved countless lives
            over the years. One cat in the United Kingdom warns her human when he’s about to have an epileptic seizure,
            while a cat in Montana woke up its two humans when a gas pipe started leaking. Firefighters told the couple
            that the house could easily have exploded if not for cat’s intervention.
            One cat has even received the highest medal available to military animals. Simon the cat was onboard the HMS
            Amethyst, which was sailing up the Yangtze in 1949 when a shell hit the ship, killing several marines and
            severely injuring Simon. (The event marked the beginning of the 101-day siege of the ship, which would
            become known as the Yangtze Incident.) Simon was fixed up, and despite being injured, performed his ship
            duty and started catching the rats that were threatening the ship’s food supply, as well as providing moral
            support for the surviving sailors. Simon died not long after the ship returned to the UK, but he was
            posthumously awarded the UK’s Dickin Medal, recognized as the animal Victoria Cross, for "behaviour [of] the
            highest order, although the blast was capable of making a hole over a foot in diameter in a steel plate."  <br>

        <h3 class="h3"> 3 Scientific Benefits of Being a dog Owner</h3>
        <p class="p2">1. DOGS MAKE US FEEL LESS ALONE .
            Dogs can be there for you even when people can’t. They offer unconditional love, emotional support, and
            constant cuddles that help stave off social isolation. A small Australian study discovered that dog
            ownership reduces loneliness.
  A national survey of pet owners and non-pet owners by the Human Animal Bond Research Institute found that 85
            percent of respondents believe that interaction with pets reduces loneliness. Most agree that human-pet
            interactions can help address social isolation. <br>
<br>
         2. DOGS ARE GOOD FOR YOUR HEART.
            Owning a dog can help you live longer. A comprehensive review of studies published between 1950 and 2019
            found that dog owners had a lower risk of death. Studies suggest that dog owners have lower blood pressure
            levels and improved responses to stress.
Even just living with a dog makes a difference—people who had experienced previous coronary events had an
            even higher level of risk reduction for death. Research has concluded that the bond between humans and dogs
            reduces stress, which is a major cause of cardiovascular <br>
<br>
        3. DOGS ENCOURAGE YOU TO MOVE .
            Those long treks along sidewalks, trails, and paths add up. A 2019 British study discovered that dog owners
            are nearly four times more likely than non-dog owners to meet daily physical activity guidelines. Dog owners
            spend nearly 300 minutes every week walking with their dogs. That’s 200 more minutes walking than people
            without a pup of their own.  <br>

    <h3 class="h3"> 3 Costs of Owning a Cat </h3>
<p class="p3">
    1.VACCINATION .
    You’ll want to keep your cat vaccinated against rabies, feline distemper and an upper respiratory disease known as feline viral rhinotracheitis. According to PetCareRx.com, you’ll spend as much as $80 on core vaccinations for kittens in their first year. After that, vaccination costs drop to roughly $50 a year for a healthy feline.
As with spay/neuter costs, you should do a quick internet search for low-cost animal health clinics that offer vaccinations. If you’re adopting, your adoption center may alert you to such clinics as mine did. <br>
<br>
2. FOOD AND LITTER .
Food and litter will be the bulk of your annual expenses for your cat. And how much you spend depends on the kind and brand of food you want to give your cat (wet, dry or a mix) and the type of litter you/they prefer. Typically, if you decide to feed your cat a mostly raw diet, it’s going to cost you.
My costs for food and litter are on average $60 a month, or $720 a year. Each month, I order one 8.5-pound jug of Tidy Cats Lightweight Glade Scented Clumping litter and three 24-can cases of 3-ounce cans of Fancy Feast from pet supplier Chewy.com. I save close to 5% by participating in the site’s autoship program, which ships my order at a predetermined time each month. I can edit my order to include extra toys or treats, or cancel a month if needed. <br>
<br>
3. TAYS .
To help keep your furniture from being scratched up—and to keep your kitty engaged—you’ll want to play with them a lot. And that means buying toys, but don’t go overboard – cats have pretty cheap taste in toys. On average, I spend roughly $25 a year on cat toys, and that includes the trusted feather toy. If you want to spend $0 a year on cat toys, just wait until your next delivery of, well, anything. Your cat will have fun with an empty box, packing paper or an empty bag. For more free fun, you can also chase your cat around your residence. <br>

    <h3 class="h3"> 3 Costs of Owning a dog </h3>
    <p class="p4 ">   
     .1  ANIMAL HOUSE.
     There are many things we may not realize about dogs: A crate, for example, may seem cruel to some parents, but dogs like the security a crate provides—it’s like a cozy house. In addition to giving your pup a sense of security, crates are an asset for potty training, according to Travis Brorsen, Animal Planet’s pet expert, trainer, and host of the show My Big Fat Pet Makeover. Crates range from $40 for a small size to upwards of $100 for a larger size. Dog beds are typically used inside the crate, and they range from $30 to $50, depending on the size and materials used. To save some cash, choose a crate that will grow with your puppy. You can always make it cozy by adding blankets or a dog bed, keeping a towel over the top, and placing it in a quiet corner of your home. <br>
    <br>
     .2 K-9 KINDERGARTEN .
    “Sit, stay, and come are the three basic obedience commands that every dog should know,” says Brorsen. You can attempt to teach your pup a few simple commands by reading books or watching YouTube videos, but the application isn’t always as easy as it looks. It may be a lot less frustrating and time-consuming to sign up for a group training class at your local pet store or seek out a reputable dog trainer. “By taking classes, you can prevent many issues before they arise. Group classes are more affordable than private lessons, and I recommend all dog owners at least enroll in a puppy class for socialization,” says Brorsen. Chain pet stores offer group classes for around $100. “It is very important your puppy is socialized in the first seven months of age. This is a critical time for your dog to adapt and learn how to properly socialize with other dogs. It’s also good for the owners to learn what is proper play and what is too much,” says Brorsen. <br>
    <br>
    .3 IS THERE A DOC IN THE HOUSE .
    The cost of owning a dog is arguably worth it for a furry friend. But dog owners pay around $800 annually in veterinary costs, according to a recent National Pet Owners Survey conducted by the American Pet Products Association (APPA). Basics like flea and tick protection are a given, but an unplanned vet visit due to injury or illness can be costly. Amy Nelson of Catonsville, Maryland is considering pet insurance after a recent scare when her puppy, Blue, suddenly stopped eating and became lethargic. “The vet, who seemed alarmed by Blue’s lethargy, expressed concern that she might have ingested something or be very sick,” she recalls. Blood work, X-rays, and $550 later, nothing conclusive was found, but happily, Blue got better. “In the end, I’d say the peace of mind was worth it,” says Nelson. When she wasn’t yet paying for insurance, fear was the emotional cost of owning a dog. Rob Jackson, co-founder and CEO of Healthy Paws Pet Insurance, says if Amy had had pet insurance, Blue would have been covered “for all accidents, injuries, and illnesses, barring any preexisting conditions.” Monthly plans with most pet insurance companies start at around $20 per month. When it comes to your pet’s health, know whether or not you should . <br>
